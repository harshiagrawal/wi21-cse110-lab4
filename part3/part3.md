## Debugging Portion:

The bug was that the function was concatenating the two strings rather than adding. If the input were numbers then it would work as it should. To fix the problem, you can convert the strings into numbers (integers) and then performing addition on the numbers. There is a function called parseInt that will turn the string into ints.
